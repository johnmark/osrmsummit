Open Source Risk Management Summit

Topics

Measuring Risk	- What metrics can be used to measure risk. How does one determine acceptable risk? What are the baselines from which to measure trends?

Compliance Automation -	What are the limits of automation in the context of vulnerability remediation and license compliance? 
	When is automation appropriate? What are common unforeseen consequences?

Open Source & Holistic Risk Management 	- How do we adjudge risk in the context of open source software, both from a usage and a contribution standpoint? What are the real risks and which ones are commonly missed? Once we have an adequate framework for judging risk, what's a reasonable way to manage risk? What's an appropriate tolerance for risk?

Corporate Sustainability	- What is the obligation of a company that depends on open source software towards the sustainability of open source communities it relies on? How should this be incorporated into a risk-based view and risk management in general?
